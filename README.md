****(A* Pathfinding Visualization with Pygame)****

This Python program demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm using the Pygame library for visualization. A* is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. In this implementation, the algorithm is applied to a grid-based environment where nodes can be either open, closed, barriers, the start node, the end node, or part of the final path.

**Features**
_Pygame Visualization_: The program uses Pygame to provide a graphical representation of the pathfinding process on a grid.
Interactive Grid: Users can create barriers, set the start and end points, and observe the algorithm finding the shortest path in real-time.
A Pathfinding Algorithm:* The A* algorithm efficiently explores possible paths to find the optimal route from the start node to the end node.

**Instructions**
Setup:
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required libraries using the following command:
Copy code: pip install pygame

Run the Program:
Execute the program by running the main.py file.
Follow on-screen instructions to set the start point, end point, and create barriers.
Press the SPACEBAR to run the A* algorithm and find the shortest path.
Press C to clear the grid and start over.

Interact with the Grid:
Left-click to set the start point, end point, or create barriers.
Right-click to remove barriers or reset nodes.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Pygame
